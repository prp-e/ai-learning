# My Artificial Intelligence Experiences

In this repository, I put everything I learn about AI and machine learning. You can follow my repo to find new codes. But remember, I'm an absolute beginner in AI, so my codes are not that useful. 

## Projects list 

* [Prediction](./Prediction) - Prediction of body weight using brain weight. 
* [ErrorCalculation](./ErrorCalculation) - Calculation of dataset error and prediction error.
